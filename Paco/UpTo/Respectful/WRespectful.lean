### Extended Weak Respectfulness

The standard WRespectful requires BOTH `l ≤ r` AND `l ≤ F r`. But in Coq's compatible'
context where gf' = id ⊔ gf is used, the condition `l ≤ gf' r = l ≤ r ⊔ F r` can be
satisfied by EITHER `l ≤ r` OR `l ≤ F r`.

This motivates WRespectfulExt, which has:
- Hypothesis: l ≤ r ⊔ F r (satisfied by either branch)
- Conclusion: clo l ≤ rclo clo r ⊔ F (rclo clo r) (lands in extended generator)

This is the condition that actually matches Coq's compatible' proof structure.

/-- Extended weak respectfulness: the condition used in Coq's compatible' proofs.

This version uses the "extended generator" formulation:
- Input: l ≤ extendedGen F r = l ≤ r ⊔ F r
- Output: clo l ≤ extendedGen F (rclo clo r) = rclo clo r ⊔ F (rclo clo r)

The key property is that the input condition is satisfied by EITHER l ≤ r OR l ≤ F r,
not requiring both simultaneously. This allows the tagged rclo proof to work. -/

  respect : ∀ l r, l ≤ r ⊔ F r → clo l ≤ rclo clo r ⊔ F (rclo clo r)

/-- Any Compatible' monotone closure satisfies WRespectfulExt.

This is because:
- clo l ≤ clo (r ⊔ F r) by monotonicity (since l ≤ r ⊔ F r)
- clo (r ⊔ F r) ≤ clo r ⊔ F (clo r) by Compatible'
- clo r ≤ rclo clo r by rclo.clo_base, and F respects ≤ -/

/-- Extended weak respectfulness implies rclo clo is Compatible'.

This theorem shows that if clo is weakly respectful, then rclo clo satisfies
the compatibility condition: rclo clo (R ⊔ F R) ≤ rclo clo R ⊔ F (rclo clo R).

**Proof strategy** (following Coq's wrespect0_compatible'):

The key insight is that Compatible' F clo = Compatible (extendedGen F) clo, where
extendedGen F R = R ⊔ F R. When working with this "extended generator", the
WRespectful GF condition `l ≤ (extendedGen F) r = l ≤ r ⊔ F r` is IMPLIED by `l ≤ r`.

This means we can apply WRespectful whenever we have `l ≤ r`, since:
- LE condition: `l ≤ r` (given)
- GF condition: `l ≤ r ⊔ F r` (follows from l ≤ r by le_sup_left)

The proof proceeds by induction on rclo:
- Base case: Elements from R go to rclo clo R (left), elements from F R go to F (rclo clo R)
- Clo case: Apply WRespectful with l = R' and r = rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)
  - LE: R' ≤ rclo clo (R ⊔ F R) is given by the rclo constructor
  - GF: R' ≤ rclo clo (R ⊔ F R) ⊔ F (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)) follows from LE
  - WRespectful gives: clo R' ≤ F (rclo clo (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)))
  - By rclo_rclo: rclo clo (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)) ≤ rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)
  - By F.mono: F (rclo clo (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R))) ≤ F (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R))
  - Now use the IH: rclo clo (R ⊔ F R) ≤ rclo clo R ⊔ F (rclo clo R)
  - By F.mono: F (rclo clo (R ⊔ F R)) ≤ F (rclo clo R ⊔ F (rclo clo R))
  - Finally show F (rclo clo R ⊔ F (rclo clo R)) ≤ rclo clo R ⊔ F (rclo clo R)

/-- Extended weak respectfulness implies the closure is contained in the companion.

This is the key lemma connecting wrespectful to the companion.

**Proof strategy**: Show rclo clo R ≤ companion F R using rclo_smallest.
This requires showing the companion is clo-closed, which involves:
- Using WRespectfulExt on guarded inputs (F(companion F R))
- Handling unguarded inputs (R) via companion_extensive

**Note**: The proof has a circular dependency that requires either:
1. A weaker Compatible' definition (as in Coq paco)
2. A coinductive argument showing companion is clo-closed
3. A well-founded induction on rclo depth

Currently uses wrespect_compatible' in the extended form. -/
